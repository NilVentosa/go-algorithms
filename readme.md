# go-algorithms

Trying to learn go and also improve my algorithms so this is just a place to store the ones that have a name

## heap

Will generate all permutations of the input. To run it `go run heap.go ${space separated list of arguments}`

## fibonacci

Will print the nth Fibonacci number. To run it `go run fibonacci.go $n $algorithm`. Options for the algorithm argument are:

+ `bot` to run the bottom-up version
+ `memo` to run the memoized version
+ `bad` to run a slow recurrent one

## peak finder

There is a 1d and 2d versions. Cannot be run from the command line. They find a peak.
